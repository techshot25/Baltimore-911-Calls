## Baltimore 911 calls
This code looks at the dataset `911_calls_for_service.csv` which contains over 22.4 million 911 calls made in the city of Baltimore. I will clean up the dataset to focus on the relationship between **call time**, **priority**, and **district**. I intend to train a classifier to accurately predict the **priority** of a given call based on the **call time** and **district**.

This dataset records the time, location, priority, and reason for calls to 911 in the city of Baltimore.
